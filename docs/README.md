# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation. This repository centralizes processes, roles, checklists, and templates to enable consistent, streamlined project execution across all teams.

## Project Management Processes Summary
OctoAcme's project management approach emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-driven decisions. Projects move through well-defined lifecycle stages—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective—with communication and risk management best practices throughout. Key roles (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer) and core artifacts (Project Charter, Roadmap, Backlog, Risk Register, etc.) are clearly defined to accelerate onboarding and ensure repeatable success.
